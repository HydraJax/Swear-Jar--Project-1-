This application works just like the swear jar at home, but for websites you visit too often.  You simply list the websites that you "promise yourself" you are going to stay away from, select a non profit to donate to, and then select an amount you want to donate.  "Swear Jar" will automatically remember the websites you visited and donate the amount you elected to the non profit of your choice.
